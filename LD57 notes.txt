astroid harvesting spaceship. 
each "day" get dropped off in the astroid field, they came drifting in from the edges. 
	-the longer a day goes the stronger the astroids get
fly around, initially sluggish
shoot at astroids (use fuel? Maybe lasers to explain power use?)
Collect minerals
when fuel (or health) runs out the day is over, get picked up with any minerals collected. 
The main point of the game is of course the upgrade tree, unlock upgrades with minerals
